Programming languages are highly structured and logical, insensitive to the naming of functions and variables, yet very sensitive to the flow of data and logic. Changing variable or function names does not affect the meaning of a program, but a single logical error can alter its entire function and purpose.
As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:case}, the use of BLEU and ES in evaluating code similarity is problematic. 
For $src_1$, the variation from the original $src$ is confined to variable $num$'s type conversion, which leads to high BLEU and ES scores. However, this alteration completely changes the intent of the code. Similarly, $src_2$ achieves high BLEU and ES scores, yet the semantics of the function are lost. Conversely, $src_3$ undergoes normalization of function and variable names, causing no semantic shift yet scoring zero in BLEU against the original code. The example of $src_4$ is more extreme: if the program logic is broken down into multiple lines, the ES drops to 41.4\%, falsely indicating a low similarity. However, during compilation, names are typically standardized by the compiler, and source code is often broken down into basic operations depending on optimization. For this reason, the ability to recompile and execute the code is far more indicative than N-gram or edit similarity for evaluating decompilation efficacy.

To address the gap in decompilation assessment, we introduce Decompile-Eval, the first benchmark to evaluate the re-compilability and re-executability of decompilation systems. This benchmark is derived from HumanEval~\cite{humaneval}, which is the leading benchmark for code generation assessment and includes 164 programming challenges with accompanying Python solutions and assertions. We converted these Python solutions and assertions into C, making sure that they compile with the GCC compiler using standard C libraries and pass all the original assertions. In our evaluation process (Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline}), the C source code is first compiled into a binary, then disassembled into assembly code, and finally fed into the decompilation system to be reconstructed back into C source code. This regenerated C code is compiled with GCC to test re-compilability and combined with the original assertions to check if it can successfully execute and pass those assertions. 
Re-compilability and re-executability serve as critical indicators in validating the effectiveness of a decompilation process. When decompiled code can be recompiled, it provides strong evidence of syntactic integrity. It ensures that the decompiled code is not just readable, but also adheres to the structural and syntactical standards expected by the compiler. 
However, syntax alone does not guarantee semantic equivalence to the original pre-compiled program. Re-executability provides this critical measure of semantic correctness. By re-compiling the decompiled output and running the test cases, we assess if the decompilation preserved the program logic and behavior.
Together, re-compilability and re-executability indicate syntax recovery and semantic preservation - both essential for usable and robust decompilation.
